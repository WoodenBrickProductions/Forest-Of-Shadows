ABOUT THE MAP
-------------------------

*This is the first goal, it consists of
   -A working combat system
   -A working map(pathing, clipping)
   -Boss AI
   -A rock

//See combat system requirements in COMBAT
//See AI requirements in AI

*The big box is the boss
*The small box is the player
*The rock looking thing is a rock
*If you fall of the map you die
*This is a place holder map, its shape will be similar, but its quality will get better (hopefully)
