Idea
--------------

The game is a souls-like game. Its main goal is to achieve imposible difficulty if played without thought, and incourage thinking ahead, predicting enemy movements and relying as least as possible on
reflexes. The game is set in a 2.5D esthetic, relies heavily upon twitchy movements, quick fights and quick thinking. The PvE prioritizes dealing with enemys, that are stronger and faster in every way, but are
predictable. The most important feature to achieve, is the ability for a master of this game to be able to beat the PvE portion without a sweat. That can be achieved with a careful-planning oriented combat
mechanic. It gives you simple attacks, but full control of them. The system relies on attacking and countering your enemys movements by matching your attacks respectifully. The one who gets the first hit will
most often be the winner.

-----------------------------------
Combat Mechanic
-----------------------------------

The combat mechanic consists of simple attacks, such as swiping from above, below, from the side, stabbing, slicing, etc. The attacks are also the blocking mechanic, which is based on cross
intersections, meaning an attack from the side can be countered by an attack from the bottom or top. This system sort of resembles real life fighting, much like in a normal souls like game, but it is sped up
by a lot. This is NOT a game focused on timing and reactions. Theres not enough time for that. Instead you need to predict what your enemys going to be doing. If you are taking the most efficient way of
comboing your attacks, your opponent will know and they will use that to their advantage. So having the skill ta variate your combat style is the main advantage you can achieve over your enemy. Another key
factor is dodging. The dodging mechanic consists of a slide, a roll, and a jump. The slide lets you keep a lot more control, but doesnt give much distance, and a charging style enemy will quickly counter that.
A roll gives you moderate distance, but disables your ability to attack and can be countered by good timing. The jump gives you massive distance, but reduces your stamina. The stamina bar and strength bar is also
a key feature. The stamina bar indicates the percentage of an attacks speed, time of strength gain and damage dealt. The strength is like a charge meter for your attack, the longer you charge, the more 
devastating the blow. The strength retains itself if your attacks are efective, meaning if you slash from one side and then the other, it will be more effective than slashing from the same side twice, since 
it will make a time gap between attacks. Meaning your path to victory is simple - get a way to penetrate your enemys defences with quick and strong variation attacks, and then unleash a baller array of 
powerful attacks.

Examples and situations
---------------------------------------

Lets imagine a situation, where the enemy is holding an axe, and your honding a rapier. Obviously, the axe wielder will try to use strong attacks, to maximize his efficiency, and the rapier wielder will
use stabs and quick movements. But in the situation where the two players are vastly experianced, they wont do the most effective strategies, since they are too predictable. Istead, for instance, the axe
wielder could try waiting out a lunge from the rapier holder, side step, then push them back with a light axe lunge, then while the enemy is not in battle formation charge up their axe for an attack from above,
or a powerful side slash. Ultimately, the rapier wielder has the only option of jumping away, or rolling in the direction where the attack is least likely to hit. If the rapier wielder understands this 
scenario, he could try going in with powerful blows. Even though it takes a lot less charge to block a fully charged rapier attack, this keeps the axe wielder locked, since he doesnt have enough time to charge
a proper attack. In this case, he either continues blocking, or tries to dodge, which can prove to be fatal, if the rapier starts charging. This scenario shows the limitless posibilities of counter play, and
In a perfect world weapons, armor and landscapes would mean nothing, and this would all be dependant on the players experiance and skill.

Another scenario would be PvE. The player could be facing a dungeon boss, who has much greater speeds, damage and range. If the player cant figure out the bosses patterns and then turn them against the
the boss, they will undoubtedlly lose.
